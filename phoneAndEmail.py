# Step - 01: Create a Regex for Phone Numbers

phoneRegex = re.compile(r'''(
    (\d{3}|\(\d{3}\))?              # area code - The phone number begins with an optional area code, so the area code group is followed with a                                 question mark. the area code can be just three digits (that is, \d{3}) or three digits within parentheses                       (that is, \(\d{3}\)).

    (\s|-|\.)?                      # seperator - The phone number separator character can be a space (\s), hyphen (-), or period (.), so           these                             parts should also be joined by pipes

    (\d{3})                         # first 3 digits

    (\s|-|\.)                       # seperator

    (\s*(ext|x|ext.)\s*(\d{2,5}))?  # extension

    )''', re.VERBOSE)


# Step - 02: Create a Regex for email addresses. The username part of the email address u is one or more characters that can be any of the following: lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, a dot, an underscore, a percent sign, a plus sign, or a hyphen. You can put all of these into a character class: [a-zA-Z0-9._ % +-].

emailRegex = re.compile(r'''(
    [a-zA-Zo-9._%+-]+         # username
    @                         # @ symbol
    [a-zA-Zo-9.-]             # domain name
    (\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4})         # dot-somthing
)''', re.VERBOSE)

# step - 03: Find All Matches in the Clipboard Text

# Find matches in clipboard text.

text = str(pyperclip.paste())

# It starts off as an empty list, and a couple for loops. For the email addresses, you append group 0 of each match w. For the matched phone numbers, you donâ€™t want to just append group 0. While the program detects phone numbers in several formats, you want the phone number appended to be in a single, standard format. The phoneNum variable contains a string built from groups 1, 3, 5, and 8 of the matched text v. (These groups are the area code, first three digits, last four digits, and extension.)


matches = []
for groups in phoneRegex.findall(text):
    phoneNum = '-'.join([groups1], groups[3], groups[5])
    if groups[8] != '':
        phoneNum += 'x'+groups[8]
    machtes.append(phoneNum)

for groups in emailRegex.findall(text):
    matches.append(groups[0])

# There is one tuple for each match, and each tuple contains strings for each group in the regular expression. Remember that group 0 matches the # # # entire regular expression, so the group at index 0 of the tuple is the one you are interested in


# Step 4: Join the Matches into a String for the Clipboard

# Now that you have the email addresses and phone numbers as a list of strings in matches, you want to put them on the clipboard. The pyperclip.copy() function takes only a single string value, not a list of strings, so you call the join() method on matches.

# Copy results to the clipboard.

if len(matches) > 0:
    pyperclip.copy('\n'.join(matches))
    print('Copied to clipboard:')
    print('\n'.join(matches))

else:
    print('No phone numbers or email addresses found.')
